# UrbanGarden

Controller for my raised bed.

I have a MQTT broker running on a server.
At the moment only the moisture sensors can be read out.

In the future the pumps shall be controllable by the web server. 
Also I plan to add a SI7021 via I2C for measuring the environment temperature and humidity.
